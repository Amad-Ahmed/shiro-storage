# Chainlink Automation

## Why?

Used to periodically run garbage collection to delete expired files.

## Set up

- Go to [https://automation.chain.link/](https://automation.chain.link/)
- Click on "Register new upkeep"
- Trigger - "Custom logic"
- Enter the `ShiroStore` contract's deployed address
- Give any upkeep name, starting balance of 5 is fine and check data is not needed.

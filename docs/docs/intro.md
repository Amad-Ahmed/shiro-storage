# Shiro Storage

<!-- A storage platform to upload files using only client and contract code - no web2 services necessary! -->

A platform that helps you build decentralized apps which need to store files - of any kind.

You don't need to set up any "web2" APIs, services or daemons. All you need is a Solidity contract and a client that calls it.

## Why?

There was a lack of storage platforms for the decentralized web that could work with only a client and a contract.

For example, IPFS practically requires you to host a node yourself or use a provider to pin it if you need the file later. Services like web3.storage require you to pay in USD and cannot be done via a contract function call.

# Shiro

Shiro is a storage ecosystem with a focus on ease-of-use and simplicity (for the user).

## The Network

The Shiro Network has these projects:
- [**Shiro Share**](https://share.shiro.network): a simple, fast and convenient **instant file sharing platform**. No wallet necessary (you can use one if you have). Files are kept long-term.
- **Shiro Storage**: a storage platform to upload files using only client and contract code - no web2 services necessary!

## Getting Started

If you're looking to upload files to share with others, you don't need to set up anything - just head over to [Shiro Share](https://share.shiro.network) and start uploading.

If you want to manage files in your decentralized app and don't want anything more than a frontend and a Solidity contract, see [Shiro Storage](#).
